- The wallet CLI structure has been significantly reworked and simplified.
  Alias argument is now obligatory for key generation / derivation
  commands. Feature of raw (non-HD) key generation has been restored,
  which was removed in the previous release. Key export / import
  functionality for both transparent and shielded key kinds has been
  implemented. Additionally, several other improvements have been made.
