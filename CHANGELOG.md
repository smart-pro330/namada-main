  ([\#2308](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2308))
- Updated `gen_shielded_transfer` to attach a sensible expiration to a MASP
  `Transaction`. ([\#2315](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2315))

  ([\#2321](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2321))

### TESTING

- Added e2e test for change-consensus-key command.
  ([\#2218](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2218))

## v0.28.2

Namada 0.28.2 is a patch release that fixes a stack overflow issue for nodes.

### BUG FIXES

- Fixed DB prefix iterators to avoid iterators with key that don't match the
  given prefix, which was triggering recursive call that was growing stack with
  every new applied tx and on reading state from disk on start-up. Replaced
  recursion from RocksDB that was growing stack size with a loop.
  ([\#2325](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2325))

## v0.28.1

Namada 0.28.1 is a patch release that makes improvements to the MASP, SDK, merkle trees, and chain initialization conditions.

### BUG FIXES

- Fix sdk compilation when using async-send feature flag.
  ([\#2261](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2261))
- Added back missing changed storage keys in transaction results.
  ([\#2263](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2263))
- Fix to skip pruning BridgePool Merkle trees when no signed nonce
  ([\#2264](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2264))
- Initialize token total supply to zero at init chain.
  ([\#2270](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2270))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- Preload and cache MASP verifying keys on ledger start-up.
  ([\#2272](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2272))
- Now join-network will try to look for non validator wallet in more places.
  ([\#2273](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2273))

## v0.28.0

Namada 0.28.0 is a minor release that improves the genesis setup to allow signing with hardware wallet and contains various improvements including validator liveness jailing, accounts simplifications, bug fixes, stability improvements and more.

### BUG FIXES

- Fix the start block height of the first epoch.
  ([\#1993](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/1993))
- Fix Ethereum event validation/state updates when more than one validator is
  running the chain ([\#2035](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2035))
- Fix possible underflow in MASP rewards calculation.
  ([\#2230](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2230))

### IMPROVEMENTS

Allow  the ethereum oracle to be activated / deactivated via config 
updates sent from ledger. This allows governance to shut down the 
ledger without restarts. Otherwise, disconnecting from Ethereum will
result in the ledger crashing.
([\#1764](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/1764))
- Prune merkle tree of bridge pool
  ([\#2110](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2110))
- Revert the chain ID format by upgrading ibc-rs to 0.48.1
  ([\#2153](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2153))
- Changed pre-genesis established addresses to be derived from their data.
  Improved signing of pre-genesis transactions to use the same format as
  regular transactions. Genesis token balances now can be directly assigned to
  established addresses. ([\#2186](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2186))
- Combined the user and the validator VP into one.
  ([\#2202](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2202))
- Charge gas for network usage.
  ([\#2205](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2205))
- A new `tx_become_validator` replaces `tx_init_validator`. This tx doesn't
  initialize a new account and instead it modifies an existing established
  address to become a validator. This currently requires that there are no
  delegations on the source account before it can become a validator (if there
  are some, they have to be unbonded, but they don't have to be withdrawn).
  A new client command `become-validator` is added that requires an `--address`.
  The client command `init-validator` is kept for convenience and updated to
  send `tx_init_account` tx before `tx_become_validator`.
  ([\#2208](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2208))
- Increase hardware wallet support in the CLI
  ([\#2209](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2209))
- Handle errors on loading WASMs from file-system compilation cache.
  ([\#2215](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2215))
- Implement a CLI query for available rewards from a bond,
  and improve the bond amount for rewards computation
  ([\#2217](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2217))
- Fix bug in client to allow for unjailing a validator
  that was jailed for missing liveness requirements
  ([\#2246](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2246))

### MISCELLANEOUS

- Upgraded borsh dependency to v1.2.0.
  ([\#2233](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2233))

### SDK

- Removed uses of lifetimes in the SDKs Namada trait and implementation
  ([\#2225](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2225))
- Added Send trait support to the SDK to allow its use in more multithreaded
  contexts. ([\#2235](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2235))

  ([\#2163](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2163))
- Improve the validator VP to ensure that only the validator themself
  can execute transactions that manipulate its own validator data
  ([\#2169](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2169))
- Various improvements to the PoS code, including adding a panic on a slashing
  failure, some more checked arithmetics, aesthetic code cleanup, and fixing a
  bug in is_delegator. ([\#2178](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2178))
- Added type tags to transactions to enable hardware wallets
  to fully decode transactions even after minor Namada updates.
  ([\#2182](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/2182))
- Save MASP conversion state to the state storage instead of the diffs
  ([\#2189](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues/2189))

- Public parts of shared `namada` crate have been split up into a
  `namada_core` crate. The `namada_proof_of_stake`, `namada_vp_prelude`
  and `namada_tx_prelude` crates now depend on this `namada_core` crate.
  ([#733](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/733))
