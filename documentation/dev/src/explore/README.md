# Exploration

This section documents the process of exploring the design and implementation space for Namada. Ideally, the captured information should provide an overview of the explored space and help to guide further decisions.

The content of this section is more free-form. This is largely a cross-over of both the implementation details and the design of implementation-independent specifications.
